let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// In Line3, count = count + 1 is assignment statement which increments the value of count by 1.
// "=" is the assignment operator which assigns the value of the right statement
// to the variable on the left side.
//First, the operator evaluates the value of count+1 which is 1 and since we have the '=' symbol, it assigns
// this value to count which initially was 0.
