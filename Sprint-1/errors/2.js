// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";


//In this code cityOfBirth is used before it's declared which throws an error.
//To fix this we need to declare it first.
